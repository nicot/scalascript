===========

 Because it's all Java in the end right?
 This is a little class project to implement a Javascript interpreter in Scala.
 Feel free to take a look at my code, but make sure you understand it before using it.
 If you do use my code, don't forget to credit me!

 The main file that we edit for the lab
 vim src/main/scala/Lab*.scala

 The test file we can see/edit:
 sbt test

 The grader for the project:
 sbt "project lab*-grader" run
